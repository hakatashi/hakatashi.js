============

This library is innocent, white, and so very harmless utilities, which is just created for me. Like...

```
> Math.randInt(1, 100)
24
> "Hello! ".repeat(5)
'Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! '
> [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9].remove(1)
[ 3, 4, 5, 9 ]
> (-100).mod(12)
8
```

Isn't it good, sir? :wink:
