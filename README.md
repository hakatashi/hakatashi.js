hakatashi.js
============

This is innocent, white, and maybe so harmless utilities, which is just created for me. Like...

```javascript
> Math.randInt(1, 100)
24
> "Hello!".repeat(5)
'Hello!Hello!Hello!Hello!Hello!'
> [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9].remove(1)
[ 3, 4, 5, 9 ]
> (-100).mod(12)
8
```

Isn't it good, sir? :wink:
